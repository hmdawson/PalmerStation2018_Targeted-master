Organization notes:
As of 2/7/2021 
Updated post-BMIS organization and created source file for this
Created source code to organize data for quantification code
Updated calculateRF code for this data (no RF matcher)
LTC no RP DF
Didn't need to update stds list to get good IS data since csv specified IS and concentrations
Fixed quant source code run error
Ran Calc RF with duplicates removed - fixed some bad RFratio calcs
Removed compounds in NO samples at combine and tidy, get NA for MAssFeature_Column when joining mf.dat to stds and filter out


Analysis notes:
Ran HILIC B-MIS without Acetyl CoA, AMP, GMP, Uracil, Sulfolactic acid and used 0.2 and 0.1 cutoffs
Adapted RP BMIS for one fraction, exluded riboflavin, tryptamine, and thiamine IS
RFratio calculation threshold applied (if matrix in h20<std in water, RFratio=1)
Quantification performed with volume normalization and carbon separately, both outputs
RFratios no thresholds applied since all reasonable values, glutathione replaced with Boysen et al. literature value
Changed quantification code to fix carbon nomralization (only correcting for vol SW filtered once)
Added back in replicatemin filter but exempt sea ice samples
Added samplemin filter (=6)
